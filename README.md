# Modelica benchmark suite for large-scale steady-state simulation and optimization

**At the moment this project is just a placeholder.**

To explore the practical applicability and limitations of novel 
mathematical optimization methods, we establish a Modelica benchmark 
suite of 1335 problems, obtained by converting an existing benchmark 
suite to Modelica source files. We invite the Modelica community to 
contribute additional challenging real-world test problems to this 
benchmark.
